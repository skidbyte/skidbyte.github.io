	<h2>Being safe on the internet:</h2>
		<h3><b>Basic safety precautions:</b></h3>
	<p><b>Using a VPN:</b> A VPN hides your ip online by covering it with another ip. This works by not connecting your computer directy to googles servers, but instead connecting to a different computer (with a different I) and <em>then</em> actually connecting to the internet. But most VPNs wont hide your browsing data completely, because they tend to sell your data to 3rd party companies or even the government. NEVER use free VPNs, the only way they make money is by selling your data. Get a paid VPN, they are cheap and will protect you well. You can also use them to bypass geographical restrictions on some sites like netflix to watch shows that arent available in your country. Now you might be wondering which VPN is the best? I personally reccomend IPVanish, because they are log-free, have high download speeds (about 80mbps) and great servers. IPVanish is also relatively cheap. </p>
		<p><b>Using a Virtual Machine (VM): </b>When downloading anything from the internet that may not be quite safe you can use a VM to protect your PC from viruses. You can also use a VM to hide yourself and your data from trackers and hackers. A VM simulates a PC environment inside of a program (I reccomend VirtualBox). <a href="windowsvm.html">HERE</a> is a guide on how to setup a Windows VM made by me.</p>
    <p><b>Using an OVH:</b>First of all, what is an OVH? An OVH is a powerful server which you can rent out from many providers. There are many great uses for it, such as storing data on it or just using it as a VPN because of its powerful DDoS protection. I personally reccomend <a href="https://www.ovhcloud.com">ovhcloud.com</a>. Because if youre not willing to rent out an expensive OVH server you can just rent a VPS, which also has anti-DDoS in place.</p>
